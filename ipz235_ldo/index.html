        <h2>The Charms of the Snake</h2>
        <img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images//3703047/0fbfa0c9307a74e3b6e785421e71a13df72093f1.png" alt="new update image">
        <p>Snakes, as any biologist will tell you, are fascinating creatures.
            They don't have skeletons. They don't have brains or organs. They
            just have one tube-like muscle that makes up their whole body, a mouth,
            two eyes, and a butt. That's it. An animal shouldn't be able to be alive with
            that few body parts, and yet somehow the snake surmounts all of those obstacles and manages it.
            <br> <br>
            It's at this point in the blog post that we should admit that the
            biologist we contacted about all this never actually returned our calls,
            so we had to guess at a few of the details in the previous paragraph. But honestly,
            we don't need a stupid snake expert to tell us that snakes look cool. They look cool on armor,
            on weapons, on bodies, even on hats. If you've got something that's cool already, and you put
            a bunch of snakes on it, it might actually explode, so watch out.</p>

        <h2>The International 2025</h2>

        <p>Banners, tattered but resolute, are unfurled. War trumpets, battered but resolute,
            are buffed with war trumpet polish until they gleam. Weapons, resolute but dull,
            are sharpened on whetstones in rhythmic strokes, until they are perhaps too sharp,
            and dulled up a little on nearby flagstones so no one cuts themselves.  The banners
            (tattered, resolute and unfurled, see earlier) are hoisted high, their sigils stitched
            with sequins of the most defiant bedazzlement.
            <br><br>
            That's right. The stars have aligned and the stage is once again being set for cosmic battle.
            And this time, that battle has returned to where it all began: Germany, the site of The
            International's humble debut on the world stage, where it was watched in person by many tens
            of people. Now, fourteen years later, The International returns to Germany, to Hamburg's Barclays
            Arena September 11 - 14 â€” in front of, we trust, a slightly bigger crowd this time around.</p>

        <h2>Crownfall's Final Bow</h2>
        <img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images//3703047/4d7625b8d423a09223b02308f39f8b56e96130a1.png" alt="new update image">
        <p>Back in December, it seemed entirely reasonable to bring Crownfall to a close halfway through January.
            After all, we reasoned, who could possibly need more time than that to finish exploring four huge overworld
            maps filled with tons of characters to meet, comics to read, and minigames to conquer?
            <br><br>
            Well, if what we're hearing from friends, family, dedicated fans, coworkers, bus drivers, security guards,
            and even some cats on the internet is true, it turns out a lot of people could actually use more time to
            finish everything. So we're extending Crownfall's end date one last time (for real this time) to Thursday,
            February 6. If you've still got progress to make, get moving, because the curtains for this show are finally
            actually about to, we promise, close.</p>
